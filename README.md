# Sensor Integration

In this session, we look into building simulated models of robots and integrate
sensors like LiDAR and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to make a mobile robot
move from one place to another.

## 3D Modelling and Simulation

Simulation and visualisations of sensors with a virtual model of our robot helps
us to test various techniques for achieving different robot behaviours. Let's
build a mobile robot which has an arm mounted on it with a gripper
control it the simulated environment.

### URDF

Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is an XML format that describes a robot,
its parts, its joints, dimensions, and so on. A 3D robot on
ROS, for example, [the Robonaut (NASA)](https://github.com/gkjohnson/nasa-urdf-robots),
a URDF file is associated with it.
