# Sensor Integration

Simulation and visualisations of sensors with a virtual model of our robot helps
us to test various techniques for achieving different robot behaviours. In this
session we will look into how we can build a simulated version of a robot, including
the positioning of sensors and feeding their data in ROS to obtain a certain
behaviour.

## Goal

Controlling a simulated mobile robot having LiDAR and IMU sensors.


## 3D Modelling and Simulation

### Better URDF – Xacro

### Simulation in ROS

#### Rviz

#### Gazebo

### Exercise : Missing Link



## Sensor Integration

### Creating transforms – TF Library

### Publishing Sensor Information

### Publishing Odometry Information

### Controlling the Robot Base

### Exercise : Robot moving in circles
