# Sensor Integration

Simulation and visualisations of sensors with a virtual model of our robot helps
us to test various techniques for achieving different robot behaviours. Often
simulation runs go hand-in-hand with real robot runs. In this session we
will look into how we can build a simulated version of a robot, including
the positioning of sensors and feeding their data in ROS to obtain a certain
behaviour.

## Goal

Simulation of Clearpath Husky on Gazebo, including IMU, odometry and a LiDAR.
